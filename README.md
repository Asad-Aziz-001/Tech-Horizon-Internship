# **Tech Horizon Machine Learning Tasks**

# **Task 1: Fake News Detection**

# **Goal:** 

Develop a machine learning model to classify news articles as either fake or real.

# **Dataset:**

Fake and Real News Dataset

# **Key Steps:**

Preprocessed text data by removing stopwords and applying lemmatization/stemming.

Experimented with classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest.

Group customers into distinct segments based on demographics and spending patterns.

# **Dataset:**

Mall Customer Segmentation Data

# **Key Steps:**

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature scaling.

Applied clustering techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

Visualized clusters to derive business insights for targeted marketing strategies.

# **Task 3: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews**

# **Goal:**

Build a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

# **Dataset:**

IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset
